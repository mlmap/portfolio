                        Before you start writing the code for your website, you should plan it first. What information are you showcasing? 
                        What fonts and colors are you using? Here we'll outline a 
                        simple method that you can follow to plan out your site's content and design.

                    <p>
                        A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When you're building a website, 
                        you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure and make sure they can talk to one another. 
                        This article explains how to set up a sensible file structure for your website and what issues you should be aware of.

                    <p>
                        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the code that you use to structure your web content and give it meaning and purpose.
                        For example, is my content a set of paragraphs or a list of bullet points? Do I have images inserted on my page?
                        Do I have a data table? Without overwhelming you, this article will provide enough information to make you familiar with HTML.

                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the code that you use to style your website. For example, do you want the text to be black or
                        red? Where should content be drawn on the screen? What background images and colors should be used to decorate 
                        your website? In this article, we'll take you through what you need to get started.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript is the programming language that you use to add interactive features to your website. Some examples could be games, 
                        things that happen when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling effects, animation, 
                        and much more. In this article, we'll give you an idea of what is possible with this exciting language, and how to get started.

                     <p>
                        In this article, we'll set you up with the bare minimum â€” a text editor and some modern web browsers.

                     <p>
                        You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes Notepad and macOS comes with TextEdit.
                        Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with gedit by default.

                     <p>
                        For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting with Visual Studio Code, 
                        which is a free editor, that offers live previews and code hints.

                        For now, we'll install a couple of desktop web browsers to test our code in. Choose your operating system below and click

                        Before doing anything, you need some ideas. What should your website actually do? A website can do basically anything, but, for your first try, you should keep things simple. 
                        We'll start by creating a simple webpage with a heading, an image, and a few paragraphs.

                <article><p>To begin, you'll need to answer these questions:</p></article>

                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>What is your website about?</strong> Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?</li>
                        <li><strong>What information are you presenting on the subject?</strong> Write a little and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.</li>
                        <li><strong>What does you website look like</strong>, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle.</li>

                    <p>
                        Next, grab pen and paper and sketch out roughly how you want your site to look. For your first simple webpage, there's not much to sketch out, but you should get 
                        in the habit of doing this now. It really helps â€” you don't have to be Van Gogh!

                            <strong>Noted</strong>: Even on real, complex websites, the design teams usually start out with rough sketches on paper and later on 
                            build digital mockups using a graphics editor or web technologies.Web teams often include both a graphic designer and a user experience (UX) designer.
                            Graphic designers put together the visuals of the website. UX designers have a somewhat more abstract role in addressing how users will experience and interact with the website.

                    To choose a color, go to<a href="#">the Color Picker</a>and find a color you like. When you click on a color, you'll see a strange six-character code like #660066. That's called a hex code (short for hexadecimal), 
                    and represents your color. Copy the code down somewhere safe for now.

                <h1>Dealing with files</h1>
                <article>
                    
                    <p>
                        A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into
                        a sensible structure on your local computer, make sure they can talk to one another, and get all your content looking right before you eventually upload them to a server. 
                        Dealing with files discusses some issues you should be aware of so you can set up a sensible file structure for your website.
                    </p>

                <h2>Where should your website live on your computer?</h2>
                <article>
                   
                    <p>
                        When you are working on a website locally on your computer, you should keep all the related files in a single folder that mirrors the published website's 
                        file structure on the server. This folder can live anywhere you like, but you should put it somewhere where you can easily find it, maybe on your Desktop,
                        in your Home folder, or at the root of your hard drive.
                    </p>
                    <p class="list-number">
                        <li> Choose a place to store your website projects. Inside your chosen place, create a new folder called web-projects (or similar). This is where all your website projects will live.</li>
                        <li> Inside this first folder, create another folder to store your first website in. Call it test-site (or something more imaginative).</li>

                <h2>An aside on casing and spacing</h2>
                <article>
                    
                    <p>
                        You'll notice that throughout this article, we ask you to name folders and files completely in lowercase with no spaces. This is because:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li> Many computers, particularly web servers, are case-sensitive. So for example, if you put an image on your website at test-site/MyImage.jpg and then in a different
                            file you try to invoke the image as test-site/myimage.jpg, it may not work.</li>

                        <li> Browsers, web servers, and programming languages do not handle spaces consistently. For example, if you use spaces in your filename, some systems may treat the filename as 
                        two filenames. Some servers will replace the areas in your filenames with "%20" (the character code for spaces in URLs), resulting in all your links being broken. 
                        It's better to separate words with hyphens, rather than underscores: my-file.html vs. my_file.html.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The short answer is that you should use a hyphen for your file names. The Google search engine treats a hyphen as a word separator but does not regard an underscore that way.
                        For these reasons, it is best to get into the habit of writing your folder and file names lowercase with no spaces and with words separated by hyphens, at least until you
                        know what you're doing. That way you'll bump into fewer problems later down the road.

                <h2>What structure should your website have?</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Next, let's look at what structure our test site should have. The most common things we'll have on any website project we create are an index HTML file and folders to
                        contain images, style files, and script files. Let's create these now:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> <strong><code>index.html</code> </strong>: This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to your site. Using your text editor,
                            create a new file called index.html and save it just inside your <code>test-site folder</code>. </li><br>
                        <li> <strong><code>images folder</code> </strong>: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called<code>images</code> , inside your <code>test-site folder</code> .</li> <br>
                        <li><strong><code>styles folder</code> </strong>: This folder will contain the CSS code used to style  your content (for example, setting text and background colors). Create a folder called <code>styles</code> ,
                            inside your <code>test-site folder</code>.</li><br>
                       <li> <strong><code>scripts folder</code> </strong>: This folder will contain all the JavaScript code used to add interactive functionality to your site (e.g. buttons that load data when clicked). 
                            Create a folder called <code>scripts</code> , inside your <code>test-site folder</code> .</li><br>
                       </ol>
                </article>

                    <p class="noted">
                        <strong>Noted</strong>:On Windows computers, you might have trouble seeing the file names, because Windows has an option called
                        <strong>Hide extensions for known file types</strong>turned on by default. Generally, you can turn this off by going to Windows Explorer, selecting the
                        <strong>Folder optionsâ€¦</strong>option, unchecking the <strong>Hide extensions for known file types</strong>
                        check box, then clicking OK. For more specific information covering your version of Windows, you can search on the web.

                    <h2>File paths</h2>
                    <p>
                        To make files talk to another, you have to provide a file path between them â€” basically a route, so one file knows where another one is. To demonstrate this, we will insert a little bit of HTML into our
                        <code>index.html</code>file, and make it display the image you chose in the article <a href="what-will-your-website-look-like">"What will your website look like?"</a>
                        Alternatively, you can choose an existing image at your disposal, on your computer or from the Web, and use it in the following steps:

                </article>
                <article>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Copy the image you chose earlier into your <code>image</code>folder.</li>
                        <li>Open up your <code>index.html</code>file, and insert the following code into the file exactly as shown. Don't worry about what it all means for now
                             â€” we'll look at the structures in more detail later in the series.</li>

                        <div class="html-translate">

                        <li>The line <code>&lt;img src="" alt="My test image"</code>is the HTML code that inserts an imageinto the page. We
                            need to tell the HTML where the image is. The image is inside the images directory, which is in the same directory
                            as <code>index.html </code>. To walk down the file structure from index.html to our image, the file path we'd need is
                            <code>images/your-image-filename.</code> For example, our image is called <code>firefox-icon.png</code>, so the path is 
                            <code>images/your-images-firefox-icon.png</code>
                        </li>
                        <li>Insert the file path into your HTML code between the double quote marks of the <code>src=""</code>Code.</li>

                        your are including. In this case, <code>alt="Firefox logo: flaming fox wrapping the world"</code>.</li>
                        <li>Save your HTML file, then load it in your web browser (double-click the file). You should see your new webpage display

                <p>Some general rules for file paths:</p>
                <article>
                    <li>To link to a target file in the same directory as the invoking HTML file, just use the filename, e.g. 
                        <code>my-image.jpg</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>To reference a file in a subdirectory, write the directory name in front of the path, plus a forward slash, e.g. 
                        <code>subdirectory/my-image.jpg</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>To link to a target file in the directory <strong>above</strong> the invoking HTML file, write two dots.So for example, if <code>index.html</code>
                        was inside <code>test-site</code>, you could reference <code>my-image.jpg</code> from <code>index.html</code>using <code>../my-image.jpg</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can combine these as much as you like, for example <code>../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg</code>.</li>

                        <strong>Note:</strong> The Windows file sytem tends to use backslashe, not forward slashes, e.g. <code>C:\Windows</code>. This doesn't matter in HTML__
                            even if you are developing your website on Windows, you should still use forward slashes in your code.

                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, 
                        content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
                         As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

                </h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you 
                        use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing 
                        tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, 
                        can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
                    </p>

                <article>
                    <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
                </article>
                <article class="code">
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;&#47;p&gt;</code>

                    <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
                <p>Let's explorer this paragraph element a bit further</p>
                <img src="./img/html-basic/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="grumpy-cat-small">

                <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing 
                        angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect â€” in this case where the 
                        paragraph begins.</li>
                    <li>
                        The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. 
                        This states where the element ends â€” in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the 
                        standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                    </li>
                    <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                <img src="./img/html-basic/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="grumpy-cat-attribute-small">

                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, 
                class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the 
                element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value)
                with style information and other things.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
                        <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                        <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>
                    </ol>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p  class="noted">Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters " ' ` = < >) can 
                        remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent 
                        and understandable.</p>

                    <h2>Nesting elements</h2>

                         very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" 
                        in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized </strong></p>

                    <p>
                        CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is the code that styles web content. CSS basics walks through what you need
                        to get started. We'll answer questions like: How do I make text red? How do I make content display at a
                        certain location in the (webpage) layout? How do I decorate my webpage with background images and colors?

                    <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Like HTML, CSS is not a programming language. It's not a markup language either. CSS is a style sheet 
                        language. CSS is what you use to selectively style HTML elements. For example, this CSS selects
                        paragraph text, setting the color to red: 
                    </p>
                </article>
                <article class="code">
                    <code>p { <br>
                    color: red; <br>
                }</code>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>Let's try it out! Using a text editor, paste the three lines of CSS (above) into a new file. Save the file as style.css in a directory named styles.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>To make the code work, we still need to apply this CSS (above) to your HTML document. Otherwise, the
                         styling won't change the appearance of the HTML. (If you haven't been following our project, 
                         pause here to read Dealing with files and HTML basics.)</p>

                    <h3>Anatomy of a CSS ruleset</h3>
                    <p>Let's dissect the CSS code for red paragraph text to understand how it works:</p>

                <article>
                    <p>he whole structure is called a ruleset. (The term ruleset is often referred to as just rule.) 
                        Note the names of the individual parts:</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Selector</h3>
                        <p>
                            This is the HTML element name at the start of the ruleset. It defines the element(s) 
                            to be styled (in this example, <p> elements). To style a different element, change the selector.
                        </p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Declaration</h3>
                        <p>This is a single rule like color: red;. It specifies which of the element's properties you want to style.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Properties</h3>
                        <p>These are ways in which you can style an HTML element. (In this example, color is a property of the <p> 
                            elements.) In CSS, you choose which properties you want to affect in the rule.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h3>Property value</h3>
                        <p>To the right of the propertyâ€”after the colonâ€”there is the property value. This chooses one out of 
                         many possible appearances for a given property. (For example, there are many color values in addition to red.)</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>Note the other important parts of the syntax:</p>
                                <li>Apart from the selector, each ruleset must be wrapped in curly braces. ({})</li>
                                <li>Within each declaration, you must use a colon (:) to separate the property from its value or values.</li>
                                <li>Within each ruleset, you must use a semicolon (;) to separate each declaration from the next one.</li>
                </article>
                <article> <p>To modify multiple property values in one ruleset, write them separated by semicolons, like this:</p></article>
                <article class="code">
                    <code>p { <br>
                            color: red; <br>
                            width: 500px; <br>
                            border: 1px solid black;<br>
                        }
                </code>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <h2>Selecting multiple elements</h2>
                    <p>You can also select multiple elements and apply a single ruleset to all of them. Separate multiple selectors
                         by commas. For example:</p>

                </article>
                <article class="code">
                    <code>
                        p,<br>
                        li,<br>
                        h1 {<br>
                            color: red;<br>

                        }
                    </code>

                </article>
                <article>
                    <h2>Different types of selectors</h2>
                    <p>There are many different types of selectors. The examples above use element selectors, which select all
                         elements of a given type. But we can make more specific selections as well. Here are some of the more 
                         common types of selectors:

                    </p>
                    <table class="css-table-selector">
                        <tr class="table-head">

                            <td>All HTML elements of the specified type.</td>
                            <td><code>p selects &#60;p&#62; </code></td>

                    JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity to your website. This happens in games, in the behavior
                    of responses when buttons are pressed or with data entry on forms; with dynamic styling; with animation, etc. 
                    This article helps you get started with JavaScript and furthers your understanding of what is possible.

                    JavaScript itself is relatively compact, yet very flexible. Developers have written a variety of tools on top of 
                    the core JavaScript language, unlocking a vast amount of functionality with minimum effort. These include:

                <p>JavaScript is one of the most popular modern web technologies! As your JavaScript skills grow, your websites will

                <p>However, getting comfortable with JavaScript is more challenging than getting comfortable with HTML and CSS. 
                You may have to start small, and progress gradually. To begin, let's examine how to add JavaScript to your
                page for creating a Hello world! example. (Hello world! is the standard for introductory programming examples.)</p>
               </article>
               <article>
                <ol>
                    <li>Go to your test site and create a new folder named scripts. Within the scripts folder, create a new text 
                        document called <code>main.js</code> , and save it.</li>
                    <li>In your <code>index.html</code>  file, enter this code on a new line, just before the closing &#60;&#47;body&#62; tag:</li>
                    <article class="code">
                        <code>&#60;script src="scripts&#47;main.js"&#62;&#60;&#47;script&#62;</code>
                    </article>
                    <li>This is doing the same job as the <link> element for CSS. It applies the JavaScript to the page, so it can
                         have an effect on the HTML (along with the CSS, and anything else on the page).</li>
                    <li>Add this code to the <code>main.js</code>  file:</li>
                    <article class="code">
                        <code>
                            const myHeading = document.querySelector("h1"); <br>
                            myHeading.textContent = "Hello world!;"
                        </code>
                    </article>
                    <li>Make sure the HTML and JavaScript files are saved. Then load <code> index.html</code> in your browser. You should see something like this:</li>

               <article>
                <h3>What happened?</h3>
                <p>
                    The heading text changed to Hello world! using JavaScript. You did this by using a function called querySelector() to
                    grab a reference to your heading, and then store it in a variable called myHeading. This is similar to what we did
                    using CSS selectors. When you want to do something to an element, you need to select it first.

               <article>
                <p>
                    Following that, the code set the value of the myHeading variable's textContent property (which represents the 
                    content of the heading) to Hello world!.

                    It's worth noting that these features are common to all programming languages. If you master these fundamentals, you

                    name you give to the variable:
                </p>
                
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>let myVariable;</code>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>
                    JavaScript is case sensitive. This means <code>myVariable</code>  is not the same as <code>myvariable</code>. If you have problems in your code, 
                    check the case!
                </p>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>After declaring a variable, you can give it a value:</p>
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>myVariable = "Bob";</code>

               </article>
               <article>
                <p>Also, you can do both these operations on the same line:</p>
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>let myVariable = "Bob";</code>
               </article>
               <article><p>You retrieve the value by calling the variable name:</p></article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>myVariable;</code>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>After assigning a value to a variable, you can change it later in the code:</p>
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>
                    <code>let myVariable = "Bob";<br>

                </code>

                <p>So why do we need variables? Variables are necessary to do anything interesting in programming. If values couldn't 
                    change, then you couldn't do anything dynamic, like personalize a greeting message or change an image 
                    displayed in an image gallery.</p>

                <h2>Comments</h2>
                <p>Comments are snippets of text that can be added along with code. The browser ignores text marked as comments. 
                    You can write comments in JavaScript just as you can in CSS:</p>
               </article>

               <article class="code">
                <code>/* <br>

                <h2>Operators</h2>
                <p>
                    An operator is a mathematical symbol that produces a result based on two values (or variables). 
                    In the following table, you can see some of the simplest operators, along with some examples to try in 
                    the JavaScript console.

                        <th>Strict equality</th>
                        <td>This performs a test to see if two values are equal. It returns a <code>true/false </code> (Boolean) result.</td>
                        <td><code>===</code></td>

                        <td>This returns the logically opposite value of what it precedes. It turns a <code>true</code> into a <code>false</code>, 
                            etc.. When it is used alongside the Equality operator, the negation operator tests whether 
                            two values are not equal.</td>
                        <td><code> !, !==</code></td>
                        <td>For "Not", the basic expression is true, but the comparison returns false because we negate it: <br>
                        <code>let myVariable = 3; <br>
                            !(myVariable === 3);</code><br>
                            "Does-not-equal" gives basically the same result with different syntax. Here we are testing <code> "is
                             myVariable NOT  equal to 3"</code>. This returns false because myVariable IS equal to 3:
                             <code>let myVariable = 3;<br>
                                myVariable !== 3;</code>

                    Note: Mixing data types can lead to some strange results when performing calculations. Be careful that you are
                    referring to your variables correctly, and getting the results you expect. For example, enter '35' + '25' into
                    your console. Why don't you get the result you expected? Because the quote marks turn the numbers into strings,
                    so you've ended up concatenating strings rather than adding numbers. If you enter 35 + 25 you'll get the total
                    of the two numbers.

                <h2>Conditionals</h2>
                <p>
                    Conditionals are code structures used to test if an expression returns true or not. A very common form of 
                    conditionals is the <code>if...else</code> statement. For example:
                </p>
               </article>

               <article class="code">
                <code>let iceCream = "chocolate"; <br>
                    if (iceCream === "chocolate") { <br>
                      alert("Yay, I love chocolate ice cream!"); <br>
                    } else { <br>
                      alert("Awwww, but chocolate is my favoriteâ€¦"); <br>
                    }</code>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>The expression inside the <code> if ()</code> is the test. This uses the strict equality operator (as described above) to compare 
                    the variable <code>iceCream</code> with the string <code>chocolate</code> to see if the two are <code>equal</code>. If this comparison returns true, the 
                    first block of code runs. If the comparison is not <code>true</code>, the second block of codeâ€”after the <code>else</code> statementâ€”runs 
                    instead.</p>

                <h2>Function</h2>
                <p>Functions are a way of packaging functionality that you wish to reuse. It's possible to define a body of code as a 
                    function that executes when you call the function name in your code. This is a good alternative to repeatedly
                     writing the same code. You have already seen some uses of functions. For example:</p>
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>let myVariable = document.querySelector("h1");</code>
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>alert("hello!");</code>
               </article>
               <article><p>These functions, <code>document.querySelector</code>  and  <code>alert</code>, are built into the browser.</p></article>
               <article>
                <p>If you see something which looks like a variable name, but it's followed by parenthesesâ€” () â€”it is likely a function. 
                    Functions often take arguments: bits of data they need to do their job. Arguments go inside the parentheses, 
                    separated by commas if there is more than one argument.</p>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>For example, the alert() function makes a pop-up box appear inside the browser window, but we need to give it a string
                     as an argument to tell the function what message to display.</p>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>
                    You can also define your own functions. In the next example, we create a simple function which takes two numbers as 
                    arguments and multiplies them:
                </p>
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>function multiply(num1, num2) { <br>
                    let result = num1 * num2; <br>
                    return result; <br>
                  }</code>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>Try running this in the console; then test with several arguments. For example:</p>
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>multiply(4, 7); <br>
                    multiply(20, 20); <br>
                    multiply(0.5, 3);</code>
               </article>

               <article>
                <p class="nored">
                    Note: The return statement tells the browser to return the result variable out of the function so it is available 
                    to use. This is necessary because variables defined inside functions are only available inside those functions. 
                    This is called variable scoping. (Read more about variable scoping.)

                <p>
                    Real interactivity on a website requires event handlers. These are code structures that listen for activity in the
                    browser, and run code in response. The most obvious example is handling the click event, which is fired by the
                    browser when you click on something with your mouse. To demonstrate this, enter the following into your console,
                    then click on the current webpage

                <p>There are a number of ways to attach an event handler to an element. Here we select the <code>&#60;html	&#62;</code> element. We then

               <article>
                <p>The function we just passed to addEventListener() here is called an anonymous function, because it doesn't have a 
                    name. There's an alternative way of writing anonymous functions, which we call an arrow function. An arrow 
                    function uses () => instead of function ():</p>

                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>Choose an image you want to feature on your example site. Ideally, the image will be the same size as the 
                        image you added previously, or as close as possible.</li>
                    <li>Save this image in your <code>images</code> folder.</li>
                    <li>Rename the image firefox2.png.</li>
                    <li>Add the following JavaScript code to your <code>main.js</code> file</li>
                    <article class="code">
                        <code>const myImage = document.querySelector("img"); <br>
        
                            myImage.onclick = () => { <br>
                              const mySrc = myImage.getAttribute("src"); <br>
                              if (mySrc === "images/firefox-icon.png") { <br>
                                myImage.setAttribute("src", "images/firefox2.png"); <br>
                              } else { <br>
                                myImage.setAttribute("src", "images/firefox-icon.png"); <br>
                              } <br>
                            };</code>
                            
                       </article>
                    <li>Save all files and load index.html in the browser. Now when you click the image, it should change to the other one.</li>
                </ol>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>This is what happened. You stored a reference to your &#60;img&#62; element in the <code>myImage</code> variable. Next, you made this
                     variable's <code>onclick</code> event handler property equal to a function with no name (an "anonymous" function). So every
                      time this element is clicked:</p>
                      <ol>
                        <li>The code retrieves the value of the image's <code>src</code> attribute.</li>
                        <li>The code uses a conditional to check if the <code>src</code> value is equal to the path of the original image:
                        <ol class="lower-roman">
                            <li>If it is, the code changes the src value to the path of the second image, forcing the other image to be loaded inside the   element.</li>
                            <li>If it isn't (meaning it must already have changed), the <code>src</code> value swaps back to the original image path, to the original state.</li>
                        </ol></li>
                      </ol>

                <p>
                    Next, let's change the page title to a personalized welcome message when the user first visits the site. This 
                    welcome message will persist. Should the user leave the site and return later, we will save the message using 
                    the Web Storage API. We will also include an option to change the user, and therefore, the welcome message.

                                    localStorage.setItem("name", myName); <br>

                                The setUserName() function contains a prompt() function, which displays a dialog box, similar to alert(). 
                                This prompt() function does more than alert(), asking the user to enter data, and storing it in a variable 
                                after the user clicks OK. In this case, we are asking the user to enter a name. Next, the code calls on an
                                 API localStorage, which allows us to store data in the browser and retrieve it later. We use localStorage's 
                                 setItem() function to create and store a data item called 'name', setting its value to the myName variable 
                                 which contains the user's entry for the name. Finally, we set the textContent of the heading to a string, 
                                 plus the user's newly stored name.

                        <li>Add the following condition block. We could call this initialization code, as it structures the app when it first loads.</li>

                            <code>

                                    setUserName(); <br>
                                  } else { <br>

                                This first line of this block uses the negation operator (logical NOT, represented by the !) to check whether the 
                                name data exists. If not, the setUserName() function runs to create it. If it exists (that is, the user set a user
                                 name during a previous visit), we retrieve the stored name using getItem() and set the textContent of the heading 
                                 to a string, plus the user's name, as we did inside setUserName().
                            </p>

                <h2>A user name of null?</h2>
                <p>
                    When you run the example and get the dialog box that prompts you to enter your user name, try pressing the Cancel button. 
                    You should end up with a title that reads Mozilla is cool, null. This happens becauseâ€”when you cancel the promptâ€”the value
                    is set as null. Null is a special value in JavaScript that refers to the absence of a value.
                </p>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>Also, try clicking OK without entering a name. You should end up with a title that reads Mozilla is cool, for fairly obvious reasons.</p>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>To avoid these problems, you could check that the user hasn't entered a blank name. Update your setUserName() function to this:</p>
               </article>
               <article class="code">
                <code>
                    function setUserName() { <br>
                        const myName = prompt("Please enter your name."); <br>
                        if (!myName) { <br>
                          setUserName(); <br>
                        } else { <br>
                          localStorage.setItem("name", myName); <br>
                          myHeading.textContent = `Mozilla is cool, ${myName}`; <br>
                        } <br>
                      }
                </code>
               </article>
               <article>
                <p>In human language, this means: If myName has no value, run setUserName() again from the start. If it does have a value 
                    (if the above statement is not true), then store the value in localStorage and set it as the heading's text.</p>

                    <h3>Getting hosting and a domain name</h3>
                    <p>To have more control over content and website appearance, most people choose to buy web hosting and a domain name:</p>
                    <li> Web hosting is rented space on a hosting company's web server. You put website files on the  web server. The web server
                         provides website content to website visitors</li>
                    <li>A domain name is the unique address where people find your website, such as <code>http://www.mozilla.org </code> or <code>http://www.bbc.co.uk. </code>
                        You can rent your domain name for as many years as you want from a <strong>domain registrar</strong>.</li>

                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>Many professional websites go online this way.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        In addition, you will need a File Transfer Protocol (FTP) program (see How much does it cost: software for more details) to 
                        actually transfer the website files over to the server. FTP programs vary widely, but generally, you have to connect to your
                         web server using details provided by your hosting company (typically username, password, hostname). Then the program 
                         shows you your local files and the web server's files in two windows, and provides a way for you to transfer files back
                        and forth.

                <article>
                    <li>MDN does not promote specific commercial hosting companies or domain name registrars. To find hosting companies and
                         registrars, just search for "web hosting" and "domain names". All registrars will have a feature to allow you to check 
                         if the domain name you want is available.</li>
                    <li>Your home or office internet service provider may provide some limited hosting for a small website. The available feature 
                        set will be limited, but it might be perfect for your first experiments.</li>
                        <li>There are also free services available like Neocities, Google Sites, Blogger, and WordPress. Sometimes you get what 
                            you pay for, but sometimes these resources are good enough for your initial experiments.</li>
                        <li>Many companies provide hosting and domains.</li>

                    <p>Some tools let you publish your website online:</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <li><a href="#">GitHub</a> GitHub is a "social coding" site. It allows you to upload code repositories for storage in the Git 
                        <strong>version control</strong> system. 
                        You can then collaborate on code projects, and the system is open-source by default, meaning that anyone in the world can 
                        find your GitHub code, use it, learn from it, and improve on it. GitHub has a very useful feature called <a href="#">GitHub Pages</a>,
                        which allows you to expose website code live on the web.</li>
                    <li><a href="#">Google App Engine</a> is a powerful platform that lets you build and run applications on Google's infrastructure â€” whether you
                         need to build a multi-tiered web application from scratch or host a static website. See 
                         <a href="#">How do you host your website on 
                            Google App Engine?</a> for more information.</li>

                    <h3>Using a web-based IDE such as CodePen</h3>
                    <p>
                        There are a number of web apps that emulate a website development environment, allowing you to enter HTML, CSS and JavaScript, 
                        and then display the result of that code as a website â€” all in one browser tab. Generally speaking, these tools are relatively
                        easy, great for learning, good for sharing code (for example, if you want to share a technique with or ask for debugging help
                        from colleagues in a different office), and free (for basic features). They host your rendered page at a unique web address.
                        However, the features are limited, and these apps usually don't provide hosting space for assets (like images).

                <article>
                    <p>Now let's examine how to easily publish your site via GitHub Pages.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <li>First of all, <a href="#">sign up for GitHub</a> and verify your email address.</li>
                    <li>Next, you need to <a href="#">create a repository</a> to store files.</li>
                    <li>On this page, in the Repository name box, enter <i>username.github.io</i>, where username is your username. For example,
                         our friend Bob Smith would enter <i>bobsmith.github.io</i>. Check the <i>"Initialize this repository with a README"</i> box. 
                         Then click Create repository.</li>

                        <p>How the web works provides a simplified view of what happens when you view a webpage in a web browser on your computer or phone.</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>This theory is not essential to writing web code in the short term, but before long you'll really start to benefit from 
                            understanding what's happening in the background.</p>

                    <p>
                        Computers connected to the internet are called <strong>clients</strong> and <strong>servers</strong>. A simplified diagram of how they interact might look like this:
                    </p>

                    <li>Clients are the typical web user's internet-connected devices (for example, your computer connected to your Wi-Fi, or your 
                        phone connected to your mobile network) and web-accessing software available on those devices (usually a web browser like
                         Firefox or Chrome).</li>
                    <li>Servers are computers that store webpages, sites, or apps. When a client device wants to access a webpage, a copy of
                         the webpage is downloaded from the server onto the client machine to be displayed in the user's web browser.</li>

                            <p>For now, let's imagine that the web is a road. On one end of the road is the client, which is like your house. On 
                                the other end of the road is the server, which is a shop you want to buy something from.</p>

                        <li><strong>Your internet connection</strong>: Allows you to send and receive data on the web. It's basically like the street between 
                            your house and the shop.</li>
                        <li><strong>TCP/IP:</strong> Transmission Control Protocol and Internet Protocol are communication protocols that define how data should travel 
                            across the internet. This is like the transport mechanisms that let you place an order, go to the shop, and buy your 
                            goods. In our example, this is like a car or a bike (or however else you might get around).</li>
                        <li><strong>DNS:</strong> Domain Name System is like an address book for websites. When you type a web address in your browser, the browser 
                            looks at the DNS to find the website's IP address before it can retrieve the website. The browser needs to find out which
                             server the website lives on, so it can send HTTP messages to the right place (see below). This is like looking up the
                             address of the shop so you can access it.</li>
                        <li><strong>HTTP:</strong> Hypertext Transfer Protocol is an application protocol that defines a language for clients and servers to speak to
                             each other. This is like the language you use to order your goods.</li>
                        <li><strong>Component files:</strong> A website is made up of many different files, which are like the different parts of the goods you buy 
                            from the shop. These files come in two main types:
                        <ol>
                            <li><strong>Code files:</strong> Websites are built primarily from HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, though you'll meet other technologies a bit later.</li>
                            <li><strong>Assets:</strong> This is a collective name for all the other stuff that makes up a website, such as images, music, video, Word documents, and PDFs.</li>

                    </article>
                    <article>
                        <ol>
                            <li>The browser goes to the DNS server, and finds the real address of the server that the website lives on
                                 (you find the address of the shop).
                            </li>
                            <li>The browser sends an HTTP request message to the server, asking it to send a copy of the website to the client
                                 (you go to the shop and order your goods). This message, and all other data sent between the client and 
                                 the server, is sent across your internet connection using TCP/IP.
                            </li>
                            <li>If the server approves the client's request, the server sends the client a "200 OK" message, which means
                                 "Of course you can look at that website! Here it is", and then starts sending the website's files to the
                                browser as a series of small chunks called data packets (the shop gives you your goods, and you bring
                                 them back to your house).
                            </li>
                            <li>The browser assembles the small chunks into a complete web page and displays it to you (the goods arrive at 
                                your door â€” new shiny stuff, awesome!).
                            </li>

                    <h1>Order in which component files are parsed</h1>
                    <article>
                        <p>When browsers send requests to servers for HTML files, those HTML files often contain &#60;link&#62;
                        elements referencing external CSS stylesheets and &#60;script&#62; elements referencing external JavaScript scripts.
                         It's important to know the order in which those files are parsed by the browser as the browser loads the page:</p>
                         <li>The browser parses the HTML file first, and that leads to the browser recognizing any 
                            &#60;link&#62;-element references to external CSS stylesheets and any &#60;script&#62;-element references to scripts.
                        </li>
                        <li>As the browser parses the HTML, it sends requests back to the server for any CSS files it has found from 
                            &#60;link&#62; elements, and any JavaScript files it has found from &#60script&#62;
                             elements, and from those, then parses the CSS and JavaScript.
                        </li>

                        <li>As the browser builds the DOM tree and applies the styles from the CSSOM tree and executes the JavaScript, a 
                            visual representation of the page is painted to the screen, and the user sees the page content and can begin to 
                            interact with it.
                        </li>

                        <p>Real web addresses aren't the nice, memorable strings you type into your address bar to find your favorite websites. 
                            They are special numbers that look like this: <code>63.245.215.20</code>.</p>

                    <article>
                        <p>This is called an IP address, and it represents a unique location on the web. However, it's not very easy to remember,
                            is it? That's why Domain Name Servers were invented. These are special servers that match up a web address you type
                            into your browser (like "mozilla.org") to the website's real (IP) address.
                        </p>

                        <p>Websites can be reached directly via their IP addresses. You can use a DNS lookup tool to find the IP address of a website.</p>

                    <h1>Packets explained</h1>
                    <article>
                        <p>
                            Earlier we used the term "packets" to describe the format in which the data is sent from server to client. What do we 
                            mean here? Basically, when data is sent across the web, it is sent in thousands of small chunks. There are multiple 
                            reasons why data is sent in small packets. They are sometimes dropped or corrupted, and it's easier to replace small 
                            chunks when this happens. Additionally, the packets can be routed along different paths, making the exchange faster
                             and allowing many different users to download the same website at the same time. If each website was sent as a single
                              big chunk, only one user could download it at a time, which obviously would make the web very inefficient and not 
                              much fun to use.
