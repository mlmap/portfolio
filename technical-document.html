                        Before you start writing the code for your website, you should plan it first. What information are you showcasing? 
                        What fonts and colors are you using? Here we'll outline a

                    <p>
                        A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When you're building a website, 
                        you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure and make sure they can talk to one another. 
                        This article explains how to set up a sensible file structure for your website and what issues you should be aware of.

                    <p>
                        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the code that you use to structure your web content and give it meaning and purpose.
                        For example, is my content a set of paragraphs or a list of bullet points? Do I have images inserted on my page?
                        Do I have a data table? Without overwhelming you, this article will provide enough information to make you familiar with HTML.

                    <p>
                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the code that you use to style your website. For example, do you want the text to be black or
                        red? Where should content be drawn on the screen? What background images and colors should be used to decorate 
                        your website? In this article, we'll take you through what you need to get started.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript is the programming language that you use to add interactive features to your website. Some examples could be games, 
                        things that happen when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling effects, animation, 
                        and much more. In this article, we'll give you an idea of what is possible with this exciting language, and how to get started.

                     <p>
                        In this article, we'll set you up with the bare minimum — a text editor and some modern web browsers.

                     <p>
                        You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes Notepad and macOS comes with TextEdit.
                        Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with gedit by default.

                 <article>
                     <p>
                        For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting with Visual Studio Code, 
                        which is a free editor, that offers live previews and code hints.

                        For now, we'll install a couple of desktop web browsers to test our code in. Choose your operating system below and click

                            A framework tends to take this idea further, offering a complete system with some custom syntaxes for you to write a web app on top of.

                <article><p>To begin, you'll need to answer these questions:</p></article>
                <article>
                    <p>1. <strong>What is your website about?</strong> Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?</p>
                    <p>2. <strong>What information are you presenting on the subject?</strong> Write a little and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page</p>
                    <p>3. <strong>What does you website look like</strong>, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle</p>

                <h1>Sketching out your design</h1>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Next, grab pen and paper and sketch out roughly how you want your site to look. For your first simple webpage, there's not much to sketch out, but you should get 
                        in the habit of doing this now. It really helps — you don't have to be Van Gogh!

                </article>
                <article>
                        <p class="noted">
                            <strong>Noted</strong>: Even on real, complex websites, the design teams usually start out with rough sketches on paper and later on 
                            build digital mockups using a graphics editor or web technologies.Web teams often include both a graphic designer and a user experience (UX) designer.
                            Graphic designers put together the visuals of the website. UX designers have a somewhat more abstract role in addressing how users will experience and interact with the website.

                    <h1>Choosing your assets</h1>
                    <p>At this point, it's good to start putting together the content that will eventually appear on your webpage.</p>
                </article>
                <article><h1>Text</h1>
                    <p>
                        You should still have your paragraphs and title from earlier. Keep these close by.
                    </p></article>
                
            <article><h3>Themse color</h3>
                <p>
                    To choose a color, go to<a href="#">the Color Picker</a>and find a color you like. When you click on a color, you'll see a strange six-character code like #660066. That's called a hex code (short for hexadecimal), 
                    and represents your color. Copy the code down somewhere safe for now.

                <article><h1>Font</h1>
                <p>To choose a font:</p></article>
                <article>
                    <p> 1. Go to Google Fonts and find one you like. <br>
                        2. Copy the lines of code Google gives you into your text editor to save for later.<br>
                        3. For more details about using Google Fonts, see this page</p>
