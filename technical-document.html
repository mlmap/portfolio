                <h1>Installing basic software</h1>
                <article>In Installing basic software, we show you what tools you need to do simple web development and how to install them properly.</article>
                <h2>What tools do I actually need, right now?</h2>
                <article>
                    In this article, we'll set you up with the bare minimum — a text editor and some modern web browsers.
                </article>
                <h2>Installing a text editor</h2>
                <article>
                    You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes Notepad and macOS comes with TextEdit.
                     Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with gedit by default.
                </article>
                <article>
                    For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting with Visual Studio Code, 
                    which is a free editor, that offers live previews and code hints.
                </article>
                <h2>Installing modern web browsers</h2>
                <article>For now, we'll install a couple of desktop web browsers to test our code in. Choose your operating system below and click 
                    the relevant links to download installers for your favorite browsers:</article>
