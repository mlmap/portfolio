                        Before you start writing the code for your website, you should plan it first. What information are you showcasing? 
                        What fonts and colors are you using? Here we'll outline a 
                        simple method that you can follow to plan out your site's content and design.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When you're building a website, 
                        you need to assemble these files into a sensible structure and make sure they can talk to one another. 
                        This article explains how to set up a sensible file structure for your website and what issues you should be aware of.

                    <p>
                        HyperText Markup Language (HTML) is the code that you use to structure your web content and give it meaning and purpose.
                        For example, is my content a set of paragraphs or a list of bullet points? Do I have images inserted on my page?
                        Do I have a data table? Without overwhelming you, this article will provide enough information to make you familiar with HTML.

                    <p>
                        Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is the code that you use to style your website. For example, do you want the text to be black or
                        red? Where should content be drawn on the screen? What background images and colors should be used to decorate 
                        your website? In this article, we'll take you through what you need to get started.

                    <p>
                        JavaScript is the programming language that you use to add interactive features to your website. Some examples could be games, 
                        things that happen when buttons are pressed or data is entered in forms, dynamic styling effects, animation, 
                        and much more. In this article, we'll give you an idea of what is possible with this exciting language, and how to get started.

                     <p>
                        In this article, we'll set you up with the bare minimum â€” a text editor and some modern web browsers.

                     <p>
                        You probably already have a basic text editor on your computer. By default Windows includes Notepad and macOS comes with TextEdit.
                        Linux distros vary; Ubuntu comes with gedit by default.

                     <p>
                        For web development, you can probably do better than Notepad or TextEdit. We recommend starting with Visual Studio Code, 
                        which is a free editor, that offers live previews and code hints.

                        For now, we'll install a couple of desktop web browsers to test our code in. Choose your operating system below and click

                            Before going on, you should install at least two of these browsers and have them ready for testing.

                            A framework tends to take this idea further, offering a complete system with some custom syntaxes for you to write a web app on top of.

                        Before doing anything, you need some ideas. What should your website actually do? A website can do basically anything, but, for your first try, you should keep things simple. 
                        We'll start by creating a simple webpage with a heading, an image, and a few paragraphs.

                <article><p>To begin, you'll need to answer these questions:</p></article>
                <article>
                    <ol>
                        <li><strong>What is your website about?</strong> Do you like dogs, New York, or Pac-Man?</li>
                        <li><strong>What information are you presenting on the subject?</strong> Write a little and a few paragraphs and think of an image you'd like to show on your page.</li>
                        <li><strong>What does you website look like</strong>, in simple high-level terms? What's the background color? What kind of font is appropriate: formal, cartoony, bold and loud, subtle.</li>

                    <p>
                        Next, grab pen and paper and sketch out roughly how you want your site to look. For your first simple webpage, there's not much to sketch out, but you should get 
                        in the habit of doing this now. It really helps â€” you don't have to be Van Gogh!

                            <strong>Noted</strong>: Even on real, complex websites, the design teams usually start out with rough sketches on paper and later on 
                            build digital mockups using a graphics editor or web technologies.Web teams often include both a graphic designer and a user experience (UX) designer.
                            Graphic designers put together the visuals of the website. UX designers have a somewhat more abstract role in addressing how users will experience and interact with the website.

                    and represents your color. Copy the code down somewhere safe for now.

                <h1>Dealing with files</h1>
                <article>
                    
                    <p>
                        A website consists of many files: text content, code, stylesheets, media content, and so on. When you're building a website, you need to assemble these files into
                        a sensible structure on your local computer, make sure they can talk to one another, and get all your content looking right before you eventually upload them to a server. 
                        Dealing with files discusses some issues you should be aware of so you can set up a sensible file structure for your website.
                    </p>

                <h2>Where should your website live on your computer?</h2>
                <article>
                   
                    <p>
                        When you are working on a website locally on your computer, you should keep all the related files in a single folder that mirrors the published website's 
                        file structure on the server. This folder can live anywhere you like, but you should put it somewhere where you can easily find it, maybe on your Desktop,
                        in your Home folder, or at the root of your hard drive.
                    </p>
                    <p class="list-number">
                        <li> Choose a place to store your website projects. Inside your chosen place, create a new folder called web-projects (or similar). This is where all your website projects will live.</li>
                        <li> Inside this first folder, create another folder to store your first website in. Call it test-site (or something more imaginative).</li>

                <h2>An aside on casing and spacing</h2>
                <article>
                    
                    <p>
                        You'll notice that throughout this article, we ask you to name folders and files completely in lowercase with no spaces. This is because:
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <li> Many computers, particularly web servers, are case-sensitive. So for example, if you put an image on your website at test-site/MyImage.jpg and then in a different
                            file you try to invoke the image as test-site/myimage.jpg, it may not work.</li>

                        <li> Browsers, web servers, and programming languages do not handle spaces consistently. For example, if you use spaces in your filename, some systems may treat the filename as 
                        two filenames. Some servers will replace the areas in your filenames with "%20" (the character code for spaces in URLs), resulting in all your links being broken. 
                        It's better to separate words with hyphens, rather than underscores: my-file.html vs. my_file.html.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The short answer is that you should use a hyphen for your file names. The Google search engine treats a hyphen as a word separator but does not regard an underscore that way.
                        For these reasons, it is best to get into the habit of writing your folder and file names lowercase with no spaces and with words separated by hyphens, at least until you
                        know what you're doing. That way you'll bump into fewer problems later down the road.

                <h2>What structure should your website have?</h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        Next, let's look at what structure our test site should have. The most common things we'll have on any website project we create are an index HTML file and folders to
                        contain images, style files, and script files. Let's create these now:
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                        <li> <strong><code>index.html</code> </strong>: This file will generally contain your homepage content, that is, the text and images that people see when they first go to your site. Using your text editor,
                            create a new file called index.html and save it just inside your <code>test-site folder</code>. </li><br>
                        <li> <strong><code>images folder</code> </strong>: This folder will contain all the images that you use on your site. Create a folder called<code>images</code> , inside your <code>test-site folder</code> .</li> <br>
                        <li><strong><code>styles folder</code> </strong>: This folder will contain the CSS code used to style  your content (for example, setting text and background colors). Create a folder called <code>styles</code> ,
                            inside your <code>test-site folder</code>.</li><br>
                       <li> <strong><code>scripts folder</code> </strong>: This folder will contain all the JavaScript code used to add interactive functionality to your site (e.g. buttons that load data when clicked). 
                            Create a folder called <code>scripts</code> , inside your <code>test-site folder</code> .</li><br>
                       </ol>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p class="noted">
                        <strong>Noted</strong>:On Windows computers, you might have trouble seeing the file names, because Windows has an option called
                        <strong>Hide extensions for known file types</strong>turned on by default. Generally, you can turn this off by going to Windows Explorer, selecting the
                        <strong>Folder optionsâ€¦</strong>option, unchecking the <strong>Hide extensions for known file types</strong>
                        check box, then clicking OK. For more specific information covering your version of Windows, you can search on the web.

                    <h2>File paths</h2>
                    <p>
                        To make files talk to another, you have to provide a file path between them â€” basically a route, so one file knows where another one is. To demonstrate this, we will insert a little bit of HTML into our
                        <code>index.html</code>file, and make it display the image you chose in the article <a href="what-will-your-website-look-like">"What will your website look like?"</a>
                        Alternatively, you can choose an existing image at your disposal, on your computer or from the Web, and use it in the following steps:

                </article>
                <article>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Copy the image you chose earlier into your <code>image</code>folder.</li>
                        <li>Open up your <code>index.html</code>file, and insert the following code into the file exactly as shown. Don't worry about what it all means for now
                             â€” we'll look at the structures in more detail later in the series.</li>

                            <code>

                        <li>The line <code>&lt;img src="" alt="My test image"</code>is the HTML code that inserts an imageinto the page. We
                            need to tell the HTML where the image is. The image is inside the images directory, which is in the same directory
                            as <code>index.html </code>. To walk down the file structure from index.html to our image, the file path we'd need is
                            <code>images/your-image-filename.</code> For example, our image is called <code>firefox-icon.png</code>, so the path is 
                            <code>images/your-images-firefox-icon.png</code>
                        </li>

                        <li>Save your HTML file, then load it in your web browser (double-click the file). You should see your new webpage display

                <p>Some general rules for file paths:</p>
                <article>
                    <li>To link to a target file in the same directory as the invoking HTML file, just use the filename, e.g. 
                        <code>my-image.jpg</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>To reference a file in a subdirectory, write the directory name in front of the path, plus a forward slash, e.g. 
                        <code>subdirectory/my-image.jpg</code>
                    </li>
                    <li>To link to a target file in the directory <strong>above</strong> the invoking HTML file, write two dots.So for example, if <code>index.html</code>
                        was inside <code>test-site</code>, you could reference <code>my-image.jpg</code> from <code>index.html</code>using <code>../my-image.jpg</code>.
                    </li>
                    <li>You can combine these as much as you like, for example <code>../subdirectory/another-subdirectory/my-image.jpg</code>.</li>

                            even if you are developing your website on Windows, you should still use forward slashes in your code.

                        HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the code that is used to structure a web page and its content. For example, 
                        content could be structured within a set of paragraphs, a list of bulleted points, or using images and data tables.
                         As the title suggests, this article will give you a basic understanding of HTML and its functions.

                    So what is HTML?
                </h2>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        HTML is a markup language that defines the structure of your content. HTML consists of a series of elements, which you 
                        use to enclose, or wrap, different parts of the content to make it appear a certain way, or act a certain way. The enclosing 
                        tags can make a word or image hyperlink to somewhere else, 
                        can italicize words, can make the font bigger or smaller, and so on. For example, take the following line of content:
                    </p>

                </article>
                <article class="code">
                    <code >My cat is very grumpy</code>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>If we wanted the line to stand by itself, we could specify that it is a paragraph by enclosing it in paragraph tags:</p>
                </article>
                <article class="code">
                    <code>&lt;p&gt;My cat is very grumpy&lt;&#47;p&gt;</code>
                </article>

                    <h2>Anatomy of an HTML element</h2>
                <p>Let's explorer this paragraph element a bit further</p>
                <img src="./img/html-basic/grumpy-cat-small.png" alt="grumpy-cat-small">

                <p>The main parts of our element are as follows:</p>

                <ol>
                    <li>The opening tag: This consists of the name of the element (in this case, p), wrapped in opening and closing 
                        angle brackets. This states where the element begins or starts to take effect â€” in this case where the 
                        paragraph begins.</li>
                    <li>
                        The closing tag: This is the same as the opening tag, except that it includes a forward slash before the element name. 
                        This states where the element ends â€” in this case where the paragraph ends. Failing to add a closing tag is one of the 
                        standard beginner errors and can lead to strange results.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The content: This is the content of the element, which in this case, is just text.
                    </li>
                    <li>The element: The opening tag, the closing tag, and the content together comprise the element.</li>

                </ol>
                <p>Elements can also have attributes that look like the following:</p>
                <img src="./img/html-basic/grumpy-cat-attribute-small.png" alt="grumpy-cat-attribute-small">

                <p>Attributes contain extra information about the element that you don't want to appear in the actual content. Here, 
                class is the attribute name and editor-note is the attribute value. The class attribute allows you to give the 
                element a non-unique identifier that can be used to target it (and any other elements with the same class value)
                with style information and other things.</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <p>An attribute should always have the following:</p>
                </article>
                <article>
                    <ol>
                        <li>A space between it and the element name (or the previous attribute, if the element already has one or more attributes).</li>
                        <li>The attribute name followed by an equal sign.</li>
                        <li>The attribute value wrapped by opening and closing quotation marks.</li>

                    <p  class="noted">Note: Simple attribute values that don't contain ASCII whitespace (or any of the characters " ' ` = < >) can 
                        remain unquoted, but it is recommended that you quote all attribute values, as it makes the code more consistent 
                        and understandable.</p>

                    <h2>Nesting elements</h2>
                    <p>You can put elements inside other elements too â€” this is called nesting. If we wanted to state that our cat is
                         very grumpy, we could wrap the word "very" 
                        in a <strong> element, which means that the word is to be strongly emphasized </strong></p>
